# AI-Powered-Platform-for-Anticipating-Financial-Turbulence-and-Dynamic-Asset-Reallocation
## Project Objective: 
To build a scalable, AI-driven platform that anticipates financial turbulence using multi-source data and provides real-time, personalized asset reallocation strategies across various asset classes. This enables proactive risk management tailored to market conditions.
Features
- **ETL Pipeline**: Aggregates structured (market, macroeconomic, CDS) and unstructured (news, social media) financial data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: NLP models (BERT/FinBERT/GPT) analyze sentiment from Twitter, Reddit, and financial news sources.
- **Investor Behavior Clustering**: Unsupervised learning to identify and group investor risk profiles.
- **Reinforcement Learning Engine**: Bayesian optimization + Black-Litterman models for dynamic portfolio reallocation.
- **Market Forecasting**: Predicts 7/30/90-day trends using hybrid LSTM-CNN models with attention mechanisms.
- **Explainability**: SHAP values and counterfactual analysis for transparency in model decisions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Mobile-first UI showing risk scores, asset heatmaps, and scenario-based simulations (e.g., oil shocks, stagflation).
